 * Creator Coins = non-cashable per-creator loyalty points (NOT a tradeable security).
 *
 * Deliberately has NO price-discovery / market-cap / supply-speculation fields. A coin only
 * has a fixed purchase price in platform credits set by the creator. Fans buy points with
 * platform credits and spend them on that creator's perks; points can never be converted back
 * to money or transferred between fans. The creator earns withdrawable platform credits on each
 * purchase (minus platform fee) — that is the only money path, and it already exists.
