 * Real marketplace via thirdweb Marketplace V3 (through Engine).
 *
 * SCAFFOLD: the on-chain flow is more involved than minting — it needs token approvals, a
 * deployed Marketplace V3 contract, and a Transfer/sale event sync to mirror ownership back to
 * the DB (not yet built). Until that and credentials are in place, these methods throw a clear
 * message and the app uses FakeMarketplaceService. Documented Engine routes are noted inline so
 * this can be completed when going live.
